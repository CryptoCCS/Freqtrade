Why it’s good:

Mature project with many users, good codebase to study.

If you’re building crypto trading tools (which you indicated interest in), this is directly relevant.

Opportunity to fork and customize a strategy under your profile.
How you might use: Clone this, build a “strategy pack” under your own namespace (CryptoCCS-strategy1), publish that as your work.
